# CodeQL Security Analysis
#
# Runs GitHub CodeQL static analysis on the Swift codebase to detect
# security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and potential bugs.
# Swift analysis uses the CodeQL CLI extractor (no build required for
# interpreted analysis; build-mode: none lets CodeQL handle it).
